# GCN-Test

# Question

Finally, we would like you to outline how, if given more time, you would further improve the mobile site navigation experience. Also, please describe any steps you would take to prepare such a site for production.

### Answer

If given more time, I would have loved to segregate Menu options as there are many of them and simplifying them would be great for the mobile navigation experience. I wants to explore more colors pallets with the primary colors to bring soothening effect.
Steps I would take:
1. Clear all the errors from the console
2. Follow coding standards
3. Make reusuable components
4. Unit Testing
5. Delete unusable packages
6. Follow standard security deployment procedure
